<ins>Keywords</ins>: EURO-CORDEX; Machine learning; RCMs; Statistical downscaling

<ins>DOI</ins>: [Link](https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.8190)

<ins>Variables (Input/Output)</ins>: 

Datasets
* Predictors for statistical downscaling
* Predictants for statistical downscaling and evaluation
* Outputs of RCMs (dynamical and statistical)

Variables
* temperature
* precipitation
* wind
* humidity
* solar radiation under present climatic conditions

<ins>Method Details</ins>: Benchmark article

* Statistical downscaling
	- eXtreme Boost (based on decision trees)
		+ good performance
		+ low computational demands
		+ capability to combine predictors of different nature
* Bias correction
	- Quantile delta mapping (QDM)
		+ estimates the corrected series by applying a delta change
		+ simplicity
		+ good performance
		+ based on the "inflation" approach

<ins>Models</ins>:

* Extreme-related and spell-related indexes
	- different marginal, temporal, spatial and intervariable metrics
	- Extreme-related and spell-related indexes (Table 3 within the paper)

<ins>General Comments</ins>: 

* Evaluated aspects
	- daily series
	- mean values
	- spatial correlations
	- extremes
	- spells
	- FWI (computed from temperature, precipitation, wind speed and relative humidity)
* Statistical downscaling should be considered at the same level as RCMs for many purposes
