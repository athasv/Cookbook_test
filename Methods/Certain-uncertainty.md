<ins>DOI</ins>: [Link](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EF001610)

<ins>Variables (Input/Output)</ins>: 

* Internal climate variability introduces randomness to predictions
	- "unpredictable internally generated natural climate variability"
* Inherent uncertainty in regional climate projections is certain including
	* climate risk assessment
	* adaptation management
	* decision-making	
* Model structural uncertainty: incomplete understanding of climate processes
* 

<ins>Method Details</ins>: 

Large ensembles
* 40‐member initial‐condition Large Ensemble with CESM1 under RCP8.5 
* model evaluation and inter-comparison purposes
* inclusion of extreme events
* can support regional-scale adaptation decision-making

<ins>Models</ins>:

<ins>General Comments</ins>: 

* "Internal climate variability introduces unavoidable uncertainty in regional climate projections due to its limited predictability"
* "Initial‐condition "Large Ensembles"conducted with global coupled climate models provide an expected range of future climate outcomes"
* "Their value for climate risk assessment, adaptation management, and decision‐making has yet to be fully realized"
* Important to consider combined influence of anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability
