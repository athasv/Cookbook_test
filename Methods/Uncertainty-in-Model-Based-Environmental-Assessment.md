<ins>Year</ins>: 2005

<ins>Keywords</ins>: Uncertainty; Controversy; Value-laden assumptions; Problem frames

<ins>DOI</ins>: [Link](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2005.00604.x)

<ins>Variables (Input/Output)</ins>: Data from environmental policy issues for example emissions of acidifying gases (NOx, SO2, and NH3).

<ins>Method Details</ins>: 
* Treatment of multidimensional uncertainty assessment with increasing complexity
* Emission monitoring system, complex energy model, environmental indicators
* NUSAP applicable to complex models in a meaningful way
* A tool for prioritizing uncertainties in a qualitative and quantitative way
* Ability to serve as a diagnostic tool for assessing the robustness of a given knowledge base for policy making
