<ins>Method Details</ins>: ANA is based on the popular Analog technique, which estimates the local downscaled values corresponding to a particular atmospheric configuration. Analog-based methods have been applied in several previous studies to downscale precipitation in the context of seasonal forecasting. In spite of its simplicity, the analog technique performs as well as other more sophisticated ones and it is one of the most widely used.
