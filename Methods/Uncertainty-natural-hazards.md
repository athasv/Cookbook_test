<ins>Variables (Input/Output)</ins>: 

* Area of study was exposed frequently to a wide variety of natuaral hazards
* Range of participants recruited using snowball approach
* In total twenty-five (25) participants from twenty-five (25) to seventy-five (75) years old.

<ins>Method Details</ins>: 

Aims:
* understand what a disaster risk is
* integrate technology in decision-making about risk
* find disaster risk communication methodologies

A three-face interview was constructed "to understand individual's perceptions of uncertainty associated with natural hazards" + brainstorming + indirect elicidation questions
* systematic review of mental model interview approaches
* Conceptual cognitive concept mapping (3CM)

<ins>Models</ins>:

* Mental models approach
* Key concepts:
	- uncertainty
	- knowledge
	- science
* Sources of uncertainty:
	- the scientists
	- the media
	- the communicators
	- the range of possible outcomes
	- human responses
	- the unknown unknowns

<ins>General Comments</ins>: 

* Individual's mental models to identify sources of uncertainty
	* actors
	* known unknowns
* Translate uncertainty in a meaningful way for the people (the public)
* Creation of science-policy interfaces for effective decision-making frameworks in disaster management crisis

Key influences for uncertainty:
* governance and funding
* societal factors
* outcomes
* emotions
* the communication landscape
* decision-making
