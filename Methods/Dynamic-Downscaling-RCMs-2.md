<ins>Method Details</ins>: Dynamical downscaling is based on regional models, which run on a relatively fine grid (e.g. 10â€“20 km) over a limited domain (e.g.Europe) initialized and driven at the boundaries by the coarse global model outputs. These models are able to generate regional predictions for a suite of climate variables, but still may suffer from significant biases which require post processing with bias adjustment techniques before they can be used in impact applications.
