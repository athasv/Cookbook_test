<ins>Variables (Input/Output)</ins>: 

<ins>Method Details</ins>: 

* CNNs, GANs, Long-short term memory neural network
* Performs reasonably well for extreme events (including out-of-sample extreme events)
* Important to simulating weather events with multi-decadal return periods
* Important to take into account multiple standard deviations beyond historical records
* Important to consider performance of ML models' extrapolation behavior

<ins>Models</ins>:
Models included in this review paper:
* Convolutional recurrent neural network
* GANs
* LSTMs
* Combination of ML models


<ins>General Comments</ins>: 

* A connection between extreme events and gaps using ML methods
* No clear understanding on how ML-based systems would perform in situations that area far out-of-sample
* Improve trustworthiness of predictions by quantifying uncertainty related to model structure and parameters
* Emulating expensive conventional models, rare events simulation sufficient extreme events for training should be obtained
