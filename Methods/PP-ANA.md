<ins>Method Details</ins>: PP-ANA is based on the popular analogue technique, which estimates the local downscaled values corresponding to a particular atmospheric configuration (as given by the forecasting model) from the local observations corresponding to a set of similar (or analog) atmospheric configurations within a historical catalog formed by reanalysis.
