<ins>Method Details</ins>: A multiple linear regression (PP-MLR), an extension of simple linear regression which attempts to model the relationship between two or more explanatory variables (e.g. predictors) and a response variable (e.g. predictand) by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The fit is determined by minimizing the sum of the residuals between the regression line and the observed data.
