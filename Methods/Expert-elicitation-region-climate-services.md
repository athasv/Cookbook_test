<ins>Variables (Input/Output)</ins>: temperature and precipitation

<ins>Method Details</ins>: 

In general:
* Structured expert elicitation
* CMIP5 analysis

In particular:
* Structured expert elicitation
	* Use of structured expert elucidation (SEE) for regional climate change
	* Expert elicidating judgment (individually or in a group):
		- provides additional information and knowledge that is absent from modeling approaches
		- builds a framework for discussion between climate experts and regional stakeholders
	* snowball sampling
	* estimates of future temperature and precipitation change
	* sources of uncertainty in estimating long-term changes in climate
		- rank sources based on their overall contribution
	* taking into account all possible GHG concentration scenarios

* CMIP5 analysis
	- historical data from 1975-2005
	- calculated periods: 2040s and 2080s
	- RCPs: RCP2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5

<ins>Models</ins>:

* Climate model outputs from CMIP5

<ins>General Comments</ins>: 

* Narrower uncertainty ranges for deviations in both temperature and precipitation
* Supports adaptation decisions
* "Practices are shaped by local epistemic, institutional and political cultures"
* "SEE used alongside modeling approaches, can contribute to a richer understanding of regional climate knowledge for use in climate services"
* "Elicitation methods should be considered within the ‘toolbox’ of approaches available to climate service providers"
