<ins>Method Details</ins>: It uses Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report model summary data of the HadCM3 A2 experiment ensemble which is available from the IPCC Data Distribution Centre (IPCC DDC). The tool transforms ‘present-day’ EPW weather files into climate change EPW or TMY2 weather files which are compatible with the majority of building performance simulation programs.
