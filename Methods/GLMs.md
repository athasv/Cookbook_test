General Comments:
Variables (Input/Output): Raster data (gribbed precipation data) \
Models: EC-earth (https://ec-earth.org/ \
Models (Comments/Description):
Method: An extension of the classical linear regression which allows modelling the expected value for non-normally distributed variables. 
Method (Comments/Description): Despite being widely used for statistical downscaling of climate change scenarios (e.g. Manzanas et al., 2015), GLMs have been rarely applied to seasonal forecasts.\ 
Type: Statistical Downscaling (ESD) Method \
