<ins>Year</ins>: 2023

<ins>Keywords</ins>: Social-ecological systems; Water quality, Monitoring; Uncertainty; 

<ins>DOI</ins>: [Link](https://doi.org/10.5334/cstp.592)

<ins>Variables (Input/Output)</ins>: 

Collected input from:
* temperature
* oxygen parameters
* turbidity
* pH
* indicators concerning
	- aquatic plants 
	- water flow
	- water depth
	- river bank characteristics

<ins>Method Details</ins>: 

* Water Blitz events: instructions + sampling kit
* Measuring the nitrate-nitrogen (NO3––N) and phosphate-phosphorus (PO43––P) concentration
* Coordinated of the measurement via GPS

<ins>Models</ins>:

<ins>General Comments</ins>: 

* Citizen science contributing to monitoring activities
* Estimation of nitrate and phosphate concentrations collected from field kits
* Development of resilient ways to interact with the aquatic ecosystems
* Contribution to awareness and reflection

* Uncertainty in sustainable government
	- relevance
	- accuracy
	- timeliness
	- coherence and comparability
	- accessibility and clarity
	- Pedigree matrix for nutrients in fresh water

Limitations
* Role of the citizen science in the community
* Individual characteristics of water systems and parameters
* Public access to environmental data from government(s)
