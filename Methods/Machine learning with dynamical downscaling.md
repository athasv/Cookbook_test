<ins>Variables (Input/Output)</ins>: coarse-resolution precipitation, BARRA, AGCD

<ins>Method Details</ins>: Regression using a multi-layer perception (MLP)

- "ML outperforms the BARRA-R Australian DD product in capturing the AGCD daily precipitation distribution"
- "ML performs better with input data of higher resolution (here 12 km), and the performance gradually decreases as the input data become coarser (24 and 48 km)"
- "ML techniques are an efficient alternative to DD for conducting coarse to high resolution downscaling of important climate variables"
- "the developed methodology enables the analysis of historic trends and future changes at a high temporal resolution. It also has the potential to be applied to smaller scale sites (as demonstrated with the independent Gairn dataset)"
