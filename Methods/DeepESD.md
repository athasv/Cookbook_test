<ins>Keywords</ins>: Downscaling; Climate projections; Convolutional Neural Networks; 

<ins>DOI</ins>: [Link](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-6747-2022)

<ins>Variables (Input/Output)</ins>: 

<ins>Method Details</ins>: 
* Convolutional neural networks were chosen to downscale a set of eight GCMs over the EUR-44 CORDEX domain
* Performance i the climate model space using GCM projections were tested
* First-time CNNs were used to produce downscaled multi-model ensembles (while compared to the alternative ensemble of RCMs)
* DeepESD reproduced precipitation and temperature over a historical period of  time, reducing the biases introduced by the global and regional physical models
