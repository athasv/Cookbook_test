<ins>Variables (Input/Output)</ins>: Raster data (gridded precipitation data) | EC-earth (https://ec-earth.org/. Regional C.M used: CCLM4-8-21 (CCLM4), RCA4 (RCA4), RegCM-4-3 (RegCM4), WRF341I (WRF341), WRF381D (WRF381)  

<ins>Method Details</ins>: Dynamical Downscaling using RCMs is computationally expensive delaying the provision of the forecasts and requires much more resources than ESD (e.g. saving a wealth of driving boundary conditions from GCMs). However, in contrast to the ESD approach, RCMs can provide a larger number of variables in a physically consistent way, including regional and local feed-backs which can be important in seasonal forecasting.
