<ins>Variables (Input/Output)</ins>: Data from sensors located in monitored apartments

<ins>Method Details</ins>: The problem of filling a gap in a time series is very similarto the forecasting of the same series, with the important difference that for data filling we have available also the data following, and not only preceding, thevalues we want to predict. Indeed, the most advanced approaches to fill time series use both forward andbackward in time forecasting
