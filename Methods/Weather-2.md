<ins>Method Details</ins>: 

* "For some procedures, the use of a temporally homogeneous weather dataset is mandatory, with data covering (without gaps) the same extension of time. For this reason, and since most of weather observations are quite recent, a temporal extension of weather data is performed thanks to the use of a climate reanalysis, the ERA5-Land in this case. Since observations and reanalysis do not always correlate perfectly (event with improved experiements), a checking and testing of correlations is done locally between ERA5-Land and a set of regional stations. To further improve the reanalysis, a set of parameters is obtained and use to correct the reanalysis against the regional weather signals. On the other hand, this reanalysis is crossed with the weather observations, and thanks to the use of several transfer functions, the ERA5-Land, in the temporal extension desired, is corrected to properly reflect the true weather signal of the point, constructing therefore a simulated extended observation for the desired point. Last, this corrected simulated observation is crossed and filled with the original observation in those spots available, obtaining the original checked weather observation with gaps filled with a corrected reanalysis up to the date desired."

* "Voronoi polygons based on centroids of power substations to determine the buildings that were supplied by these substations.
	- substitution: the water distribution system layout was missing therefore the road layout was used instead assuming that the water network followed its layout.
	- logical rule based reasoning : For the burst locations (sewers overload), a scenario was formulated that assumed a burst event at 100m. interval spacing.
	- another proposed approach is looking at similar historical events previously within the city or in other areas with similar conditions (table 18, p. 64)"
