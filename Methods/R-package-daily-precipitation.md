<ins>Method Details</ins>: 

* "For each observatory, the observatories located at a distance of less than 20 km and with a correlation of more than 0.7 are selected. In case there are less than 6 observatories that meet these requirements, the radius of proximity will be recursively extended by 5km until there are 6 nearby observatories". 

* "A multiple linear regression is performed with the data that the observatory to be filled and the 3 observatories selected above have in common. With the parameters of the linear regression, the gaps of the standard observatory that are empty and whose data from the 3 selected observatories are complete are filled in. No gaps are filled for a given day if any of the 3 observatories with which the linear regression has been performed have no data for that day".
