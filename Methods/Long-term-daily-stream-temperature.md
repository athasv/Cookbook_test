<ins>Variables (Input/Output)</ins>: Temperature

<ins>Method Details</ins>:

- CNNs, GLMs, XAIs
- CNNs to statistically downscaled max and mn temperatures over SSA (CNN-R: CNN model with non-linear configuration)
- "CNN showed good skills to produce plausible projections, however, differences with RAW and GLM in the intensity of the signal were identified when non-linearity was considered (CNN-R)."
