ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) at ECMWF. ERA5-Land is a subversion of ERA5, improved for a better representation and estimation of land surface variables, providing hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and lake (water) climate variables. The data cover the Earth on a 9km (0.1ยบ) grid|**USED BY FIC IN ICARIA**|ERA5-Land includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions|
