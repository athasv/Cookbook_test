Thus, the model provides worldwide, monthly time series for temperatures and precipitation for the period from 1979 to 2013|[DOI 1]("https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-5573-2022), [DOI 2](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-021-01084-6), [DOI 3](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00587-y) [DOI 4](https://doi.org/10.48364/ISIMIP.836809), [DOI 5](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.122), [CHELSA Climate](https://chelsa-climate.org/)|
